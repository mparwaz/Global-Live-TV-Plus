Global Live TV Plus 📺🌎A modern, fast, and feature-rich web application for watching live streaming television from around the world, powered by the extensive data provided by the iptv-org community.✨ FeaturesGlobal Access: Access thousands of live TV channels categorized by content (News, Sports, Movies, etc.), language, and country.Virtualization: Uses a highly efficient virtualized list for smooth scrolling and handling of massive channel lists (20,000+ channels) without performance issues.Caching: Channels lists are locally cached for 6 hours to ensure quick loading times and reduced reliance on external servers.Favorites: Users can save and quickly access their preferred channels using local storage.1HLS Streaming: Utilizes the robust HLS.js library for reliable video playback across most modern browsers.Modern UI: Clean, dark-themed, and responsive design built for both desktop and mobile viewing.🚀 Getting StartedThis application is built entirely using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it extremely easy to deploy.1. RequirementsYou only need a modern web browser and a way to host the files (local server, GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.).2. SetupDownload the Code: Clone this repository or copy the entire HTML code into a file named index.html.Add the Logo: Download the custom logo image and save it as logo.png in the same directory as your index.html file. (The current code expects this file name.)Host the File:Local Testing: Simply open the index.html file in your browser.Deployment: Upload the index.html and logo.png files to your web host (e.g., GitHub Pages is ideal for this type of single-file project).📊 Data SourceThis project would not be possible without the incredible open-source contribution of the iptv-org community.Source: The channel data (M3U playlists) are fetched directly from the iptv-org/iptv GitHub repository.Lists Used: We primarily use the stable /index.m3u (for global search), /categories/*.m3u, and /languages/*.m3u files.⚠️ Known Issues & Data VolatilityThe nature of free IPTV streams means they are constantly changing. The iptv-org repository is in a state of continuous maintenance (often addressing hundreds of open issues).Broken Streams: You may occasionally encounter channels that are offline or have moved. The built-in error handler will notify you.Geo-Blocking: Some channels may be restricted by the source to specific geographic regions (VPN usage may be required).🛠️ Code StructureThe entire application is contained within a single index.html file for simplicity:SectionDescription<head>Includes basic meta tags, the external HLS.js library, and Google Fonts/Icons.<style>Contains all custom CSS for the modern dark theme and responsive layout.<body> (HTML)The main structure: <header>, <video> player, and the <aside> sidebar containing categories and the channel list.<script> (JavaScript)All application logic, including M3U parsing, caching, virtualization, filtering, HLS playback handling, and the favorites system.🤝 ContributingWhile the core channel data comes from iptv-org, improvements to the viewer application itself are welcome!Fork the repository.Create your feature branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature).Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature').Push to the branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature).Open a Pull Request.
